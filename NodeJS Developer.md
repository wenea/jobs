# Node.js Backend Engineer at Wenea

## The company

Wenea Services is a young company founded in 2017, part of the Diggia group.

In Wenea you will be part of an ongoing ecosystem that provides services for a sustainable, electric mobility. We are looking for people with a passion in the electric vehicle and renewable energies sector, that wants to bring their best to improve the processes that makes a green future a real possibility.


## The project

This green future needs work to be done now. And currently, one of the biggest problems with the electric mobility is the low amount of active electric charge points . What's good about the iteratively higher range of the EVs, if their drivers need to fork their route in order to charge and be able to have enough energy to end their journey? Alongside a bigger energy waste, the drivers are more exposed to road hazards by driving useless kilometers. This is an issue not only present on medium distance journeys, it also affects the people that uses their car frequently, but doesn't go that far. A low amount of charge points, that are far from the destination of a person daily commute, makes it difficult to justify the entry cost of electric mobility for the common driver. This is why we started working on Wenea Platform, our own fleet of charge points that are managed by us.

This is only but a small glance at the scope of **Wenea Platform**.
You will be an active part of the continuous evolution of the project.
