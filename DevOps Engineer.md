# DevOps Engineer at Wenea

## The company

Wenea Services is a young company founded in 2017, part of the
Diggia group. Diggia goal is to be as an integrator of services 
and innovative solutions in the field of telecommunications, 
photovoltaic energy and long-term viable mobility.

In Wenea you will be part of an ongoing ecosystem that provides
services for a sustainable, electric mobility,
using renewable energies and technologies.
We are looking for people with a passion in building products and services
that help in the continuous pursuit for a better green present and a 
sustainable future.

## The project

This green future needs work to be done now. And currently, one of
the biggest problems with the electric mobility is the low amount of
active electric charge points . What's good about the iteratively
higher range of the EVs, if their drivers need to fork their route in
order to charge and be able to have enough energy to end their
journey? Alongside a bigger energy waste, the drivers are more
exposed to road hazards by driving useless kilometers. This is an
issue not only present on medium distance journeys, it also affects
the people that uses their car frequently, but doesn't go that far. A
low amount of charge points, that are far from the destination of a
person daily commute, makes it difficult to justify the entry cost of
electric mobility for the common driver. This is why we started
working on **Wenea Platform**, our own fleet of charge
points that are managed by us.

This is only but a small glance at the scope of Wenea Platform.
You will be an active part of the continuous evolution of the
project.

## Perks

As you can already guess, we love sustainability. We don't want
anyone to drive more than what it's needed. That's also why we offer
a **full remote** position. You can work from the beach, from the mountains, 
or from your local hometown that you miss. Post covid you could also come to
any of our offices in Madrid or Cáceres. Either if you come or not, you will
always feel connected with the team.

We ask you to be proactive, self organized. We believe that when a
company asks for something, they have to give something back. That's
why we also offer you **flexible schedule**. Your work
will not be valued depending on how many and in what hours you
completed it. What we are proud of is the quality of it.

We also offer **health insurance**, **flexible
remuneration** and a **career plan**, which
includes formation. You get to choose what you want to learn, what
technical books you read and the path you want to follow in your
professional trajectory.
